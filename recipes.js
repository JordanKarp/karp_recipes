While mixing, knead in the flour and the potatoes a little at a time. The dough should be moist but not sticky. On a floured work surface, take one fourth of the dough and knead it until it feels smooth, about 2-3 minutes. Roll the dough into a log approximately 1 inch thick. Cut the log into 1/2 inch long pieces. Repeat with the rest of the dough. To give the dough the traditional gnocchi shape, place a piece of the dough over the side of a cheese grate that has three or four smile-shaped holes. Press the dough down over the hole and roll it out to give it a shell shape. Repeat with the rest of the dough. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to the boil. Add the gnocchi all at once and stir gently so they do not stick to the pot. When they are done they will float to the top. With a perforated spoon, remove them and serve immediately or drop into ice water until needed, then briefly reheat in boiling water. In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat and add the garlic. Cook until the garlic is golden. Increase heat to high and add all of the tomatoes. Cook until the tomatoes break open. Lower heat to simmer and cook for 30 minutes. About 10 minutes before the sauce is done, add the basil leaves and season with salt and pepper and stir gently.",

Lightly dust with flour. Clean work surface with a scraper and lightly dust with flour. Shape potato mixture into a loaf about 1-1/2” high, 4 “ wide and 12” long. Cut 1-1/2” slice from loaf with a scraper or knife. Roll into a rope about 1/2” thick and 30” long. Cut at 1” intervals. Smooth the ends of each piece lightly with fingertips. Place finished gnocchi on a paper-lined pan. Repeat with remaining mixture. Bring large pot of water to boil with 1 heaping tablespoon of salt for each quart. Place ice cubes in large bowl, add 4 quarts cold water and place a large colander in the bowl so that it fills with ice water. Slide gnocchi from one pan into boiling water. After about 90 seconds, gnocchi will begin rising to the surface. Remove to colander with slotted spoon. Repeat with second batch. Reline baking sheets with clean parchment. With a skimmer, transfer cold gnocchi to baking sheets. Gnocchi can be served at once, set aside for several hours, or frozen. To serve, melt butter in small saucepan. Whisk in 1 c. water until emulsified. Transfer sauce to 1 or 2 large skillets large enough to hold the gnocchi in one layer. Add gnocchi, cook over medium heat until butter starts to bubble and gnocchi are warmed through. Dust with cheese and serve.",

Fill with desired filling – a rounded teaspoon works well with the 4”, a level teaspoon with the 3”.

Next, generously drizzle olive oil on a sheet pan. This will mean the difference between the potatoes sticking and not sticking, so don’t be shy here. When the potatoes are tender, place them on the cookie sheet giving them plenty of room to spread out. Next, grab your potato masher and gently press down on the potato until it slightly mashes. Then rotate the masher 90 degrees and finish flattening it. Of course, you don’t want to absolutely smash it into the pan-you want it almost to resemble a cookie. Repeat until all are flattened. And really, I don’t know why you couldn’t use the bottom of a glass for this step if you don’t have a potato masher. The surface might not be as textured and interesting, but I think it still might work. Next, brush the tops rather generously with olive oil. Next, grab some Kosher salt. You can use regular salt, but I’d really recommend using kosher. It adheres to the potatoes more easily and really flavors them nicely without getting too salty. Remember: potatoes need salt. Don’t skimp! Be ye ever as generous with fresh ground black pepper. Now, you can grab some chives…or thyme…or whatever herbs you have available. Whatever herb you use, just chop it pretty finely and sprinkle over the top. Place on the top rack of a 450°F oven and bake 20-25 minutes until golden, crispy and sizzling.\n \n",

      "title": "Potato Gnocchi",
      "category": "Pasta",
      "serves": "6",
      "directions": "Fill a large pot with cold water. Salt the water, then cut potatoes in half and place them in the pot. Bring the water to a boil and cook the potatoes until tender throughout, this takes roughly 40-50 minutes.\n\nRemove the potatoes from the water one at a time with a slotted spoon. Place each potato piece on a large cutting board and peel it before moving on to the next potato. Also, peel each potato as soon as possible after removing from the water (without burning yourself) - I've found a paring knife comes in handy here. Be mindful that you want to work relatively quickly so you can mash the potatoes when they are hot. To do this you can either push the potatoes through a ricer, or do what I do, deconstruct them one at a time on the cutting board using the tines of a fork - mash isn't quite the right term here. I run the fork down the sides of the peeled potato creating a nice, fluffy potato base to work with (see photo). Don't over-mash - you are simply after an even consistency with no noticable lumps.\n\nSave the potato water.\n\nLet the potatoes cool spread out across the cutting board - ten or fifteen minutes. Long enough that the egg won't cook when it is incorporated into the potatoes. When you are ready, pull the potatoes into a soft mound - drizzle with the beaten egg and sprinkle 3/4 cup of the flour across the top. I've found that a metal spatula or large pastry scraper are both great utensils to use to incorporate the flour and eggs into the potatoes with the egg incorporated throughout - you can see the hint of yellow from the yolk. Scrape underneath and fold, scrape and fold until the mixture is a light crumble. Very gently, with a feathery touch knead the dough. This is also the point you can add more flour (a sprinkle at a time) if the dough is too tacky. I usually end up using most of the remaining 1/4 cup flour, but it all depends on the potatoes, the flour, the time of year, the weather, and whether the gnocchi gods are smiling on you. The dough should be moist but not sticky. It should feel almost billowy. Cut it into 8 pieces. Now gently roll each 1/8th of dough into a snake-shaped log, roughly the thickness of your thumb. Use a knife to cut pieces every 3/4-inch (see photo). Dust with a bit more flour.\n\nTo shape the gnocchi hold a fork in one hand (see photo) and place a gnocchi pillow against the tines of the fork, cut ends out. With confidence and an assertive (but light) touch, use your thumb and press in and down the length of the fork. The gnocchi should curl into a slight \"C\" shape, their backs will capture the impression of the tines as tiny ridges (good for catching sauce later). Set each gnocchi aside, dust with a bit more flour if needed, until you are ready to boil them. This step takes some practice, don't get discouraged, once you get the hang of it it's easy.\n\nNow that you are on the final stretch, either reheat your potato water or start with a fresh pot (salted), and bring to a boil. Cook the gnocchi in batches by dropping them into the boiling water roughly twenty at a time. They will let you know when they are cooked because they will pop back up to the top. Fish them out of the water a few at a time with a slotted spoon ten seconds or so after they've surfaced. Have a large platter ready with a generous swirl of whatever sauce or favorite pesto you'll be serving on the gnocchi. Place the gnocchi on the platter. Continue cooking in batches until all the gnocchi are done. Gently toss with more sauce or pesto (don't overdo it, it should be a light dressing), and serve immediately, family-style with a drizzle of good olive oil on top.",

      "directions": "Disperse the yeast in the water by stirring for 20 seconds or so. Use ordinary dried yeast, not the 'easy blend' stuff.\n\nPut the flour in a mixing bowl (I use a casserole pot). Add the yeast and water mixture and stir thouroughly in one direction, as this is supposed to help develop long gluten strands. You want a very slack batter-like mixture. You will probably need a little extra water (2-3 tablespoons) if the air is dry. Lumps are nothing to worry about here.\n\nCover the bowl with cling film and put it in a place out of draughts to develop. Leave overnight, or for a shorter time if you must. \n\nDisperse the yeast in the water as before. Mix the salt into the flour. You don't need to sift the flour, but fluff it up a bit as you spoon it out.\n\nAdd the yeast and water mixture to the poolish. Mix roughly. Now add the salted flour in four stages, mixing thoroughly each time. I use a wooden spoon, but you could use a dough mixer. Add a tablespoon of flour at a time until the mixture starts to pull away from the bowl. Don't add too much flour; a little too wet is better than too dry.\n\nTurn the dough out onto a well floured surface. Now wash up the bowl. The dough will develop a little as you do this, and you'll want the clean bowl in a moment.\n\nKnead for 5 minutes or so. You will need to add a fair amount of flour to stop the dough from sticking to the surface or your hands. I probably add another 3 tablespoons of flour whilst kneading.\n\nNow oil the mixing bowl lightly (too much oil will make the crust soft) and put the dough into it. Cover with cling film. Set the kitchen timer for 30 minutes and leave the dough to develop and rise. After 30 minutes, you should lift the dough out of the bowl, stretch it out, and put it back in (in a heap).\n\nThe purpose of the long knead is do stretch out the strings of gluten in the flour, and to further mix the dough. You should repeat the long knead two more times, so the dough gets three long kneads. At this point, the dough will still seem very loose. Don't worry.\n\nNow you wan't to 'knock back' (or degazer the dough. This involves kneading out some of the air. If you were to fully degaz, the bread texture would be very smooth, with many tiny holes. Bread tastes far better if you can achieve a mixture of large and small holes, so leave about half the air in the dough. This is fairly easy, because at this point, the dough will be half air by volume. Simply knead very lightly until the dough is about a three quarters of its risen size, which should be the same as one and a half times its unrisen size (There. I said it was easy).\n\nDivide the dough into four portions, and shape roughly into sausage shapes. Dust all over with a little flour, and cover them with an oiled piece of cling film. Leave to re-rise for 30 minutes.\n\nRoll, stretch and flatten each potion into a long rectangle, fold lengthwise. Repeat the rolling and folding. The purpose is to distribute the texture throughout the loaf. Otherwise, the loaf would tend to be heavy at the bottom, and light at the top.\n\nRoll and stretch each loaf into a long, thin baguette. Place them on a greased baking tray.\n\nSet the oven to 230° C.\n\nAfter 30 minutes, the loaves should be noticably fatter. Boil a kettle, and put an inch or so of boiling water in the bottom of a deep roasting tin. Put it in the oven on the bottom shelf, or directly on the oven floor (be careful with that!). Shut the over door.\n\nIn five munites, the oven should be full of steam, which is essential for a good french style crust. An oven full of steam is also ideal for scalding novice bakers (which can be very nasty indeed). Remember steam burns, steam can be invisible, and if you spill boiling water on yourself; it's going to hurt. Lock the cats up, Send the kids into the garden. You have been warned. When you open the oven door, let the steam disperse before putting your head or hands near it.\n\nSpray the baguettes with water until they are really wet, and slash them three times diagonally. Put them in the oven on the top shelf.\n\nAfter five minutes, open the oven (careful with that steam!) and spray the baguettes with water again. If they are browning unevenly, turn the baking tray around. Repeat this after another five minutes.\n\nAfter a further five minutes (that's fifteen minutes since you put them in the oven), take out the roasting tin of water. Be very careful doing this.\n\nAfter twenty minutes, remove the baguettes, and put them on a wire rack to cool. They will be ready to eat in half an hour.\n",

      "directions": "In your food processor fitted with the steel blade, process sugar at highest speed in 3 “bursts” of about 15 to 20 seconds each until sugar is very fine-textured. (This step is optional, but it makes dissolving the sugar a much easier job.)\n\nIn a heavy 4-quart pot, butter the sides in a 2-inch path 3 inches from the bottom.  (This will retard sugar crystals from forming during cooking.\n\nPour processed sugar into the pot and add cream, corn syrup, and salt.  Place over low heat and stir constantly with a wooden spoon until sugar is dissolved; mixture should not come to a boil during this process, which may take 8 to 10 minutes or more.\n\nWhen the sugar is completely dissolved, increase the heat to medium. Add the chopped chocolate and stir often until it is melted and incorporated.  Stir occasionally until mixture comes to a boil. Attach your calibrated candy thermometer and continue to cook until it reached 236 degrees (F).\n\nWatch the boiling mixture very carefully for the first few minutes, adjusting the heat to maintain a full, but not rolling boil.  I stir the boiling mixture every 2 to 3 minutes until the final temperature is reached to prevent scorching.\n\nWhen the fudge reaches 236 degrees (F) on the thermometer, remove from heat. Place the pot into a large bowl filled with ice and water.  Add the cold butter bits and vanilla, but do not stir in.   The fudge should cool undisturbed until the temperature falls to 110 degrees F.\n\nWhile the fudge cools, prepare the pan and utensils. Line an 8 inch square pan (at least 1-1/2 inches deep) with a double layer of heavy-duty aluminum foil. With soft butter, very lightly butter the foil.  Have the nuts and a large wooden spoon nearby.\n\nWhen fudge has reached 110 degrees (F), remove from ice water and place pot on a dish towel or pot holder on a flat surface. Begin to stir/fold the fudge gently with the wooden spoon. This is a stiff mixture, and it will take a couple of minutes to incorporate the melted butter, but keep at it. Stir thoroughly, but it is not necessary to beat or to stir continuously. I take frequent breaks for 30 seconds or a minute at a time. Periodically, scrape the spoon, the pot bottom, and the pot sides no more than 1/3 of the way up from the bottom with the buttered spatula.\n\nContinue stirring for approximately 15 to 20 minutes (and the drier the day, the quicker setup will occur). Toward the end of this stirring phase, you’ll notice several changes. The fudge will stiffen slightly and begin to lose its gloss. It will “snap” with every stroke of the spoon, and you may feel it give off heat. When the gloss begins to leave and the mixture begins to “snap”, quickly stir in the nuts just until evenly distributed, and turn into prepared pan, scraping out the bottom of the pot and the sides no more than 1/3 of the way up from the bottom. It is helpful to butter your hands lightly and press the fudge out to make an even layer in the pan. Cool completely to room temperature.\n\nTo cut, lift out block of fudge, still in foil, from the pan. Peel back foil sides. Use a large, very sharp, heavy, straight-edged knife to cut the fudge into 36 or more pieces; it will be necessary to clean the knife frequently under hot water, then dry it off, to keep the cuts neat. I wrap each piece individually in plastic wrap so it will not dry out. Store between sheets of waxed paper in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two weeks, or freeze for longer storage.  Always allow the fudge to come to room temperature before serving.\n\nNote: Occasionally, when I make this, after I’ve turned it into the 8 inch pan, a thin layer of butterfat will show up on the surface as the fudge cools. If this happens, just blot the butterfat up gently with a paper towel.\n\nAnd remember while you are stirring/folding the fudge, that the reason why you are going through this effort is to prevent the crystals from forming large masses…each stir/fold is reducing their size!",

Increase heat to medium-high and cook, without stirring, until the mixture reaches a rolling boil.\n\nClip on your calibrated candy thermometer.  Reduce heat to medium to maintain a full (but not rolling) boil.  Cook syrup, without stirring, to 252 degrees (F).  Just before your syrup reaches this temperature (around 250 degrees), begin beating the egg whites with your whisk attachment until soft peaks form.  Remove the whisk and replace with your paddle beater.\n\nRemove the completed syrup from heat and allow the boiling to completely subside (about 1 minute).  Pour the syrup carefully into a heat-proof large Pyrex measuring cup to make pouring in the next step easier.  Do not scrape the pan.\n\nWith your mixer on high speed, slowly and gradually begin to add the hot syrup to the egg whites.  Once you begin to pour the syrup, do NOT stop and do not scrape the mixing bowl.  When all the syrup has been combined, continue to beat the mixture until it begins to lose its gloss and holds its shape in stiff peaks.  (This takes about 10 minutes of solid beating.) \n\nNext, add the vanilla and beat well.  Remove the bowl from the mixer stand and fold in the nuts, if desired.\n\nUsing two large spoons, drop spoonfuls of the mixture into mounds onto the waxed paper.  Allow to rest undisturbed for two hours, or until the mounds are at room temperature.

Increase your mixer speed to high and begin to add the hot syrup and continue as directed above.  Garnish with a slice of fresh strawberry.\n\nPeppermint Divinity:  After beating your egg whites to the soft-peak stage, add 1/4 teaspoon of peppermint oil to the egg white and continue to beat on high speed for another minutes.  **You may also add 3 drops of red food coloring.  Then begin to add the hot syrup and continue as directed above.  Garnish each mound with finely crushed peppermint candies.\n\nCappuccino Divinity:  Just before removing your cooked syrup from the heat, add 2 tablespoons of dark rum to the syrup and allow to “boil in” (do not stir).  Once boiling has ceased, pour the syrup into your Pyrex measuring cup.  Add the hot syrup to the beaten egg whites.  As soon as the mixture begins to lose its gloss, add 2 teaspoons of instant coffee powder and 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon and continue to beat until incorporated.  Spoon into mounds as described above.  Garnish with ground coffee beans (ground in a mortar & pestle).\n\nKahlua Divinity:  Just before removing your cooked syrup from the heat, add 2 tablespoons of Kahlua to the syrup and allow to “boil in” (do not stir).  Once boiling has ceased, pour the syrup into your Pyrex mixing cup.  Add the hot syrup to the beaten egg whites.  As soon as the mixture begins to lose its gloss, add 1 teaspoon of instant coffee powder and beat well to blend.  Continue as directed above.  Garnish with ground coffee beans (ground in a mortar & pestle).\n\nGodiva Divinity:  Use the same method as in making Kahlua Divinity, but substitute 2 tablespoons of either Godiva dark chocolate or white chocolate liqueur and continue as directed.

      "category": "Desserts, Pies",
      "directions": "Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C).\n\nFirst off you want to zest one lemon, then slice up it and the other(s). As for zesting a lemon: You have a microplane, right? If you don't, you should go right out and buy one, as it will be one of the better $20 you've ever spent. In the meantime, though, a veggie peeler will suffice to skin a lemon, but after making the peels, mince them up very well with a sharp knife.\n\nTo cut the lemons:\n\n   1. If you have any open cuts, now is the time to cover them. If you know what supreming a lemon means, peel it for that, then cut in cartwheels, removing seeds as you go.\n   2. If you don't know supreming is, do this:\n          * Get a really sharp knife.\n          * Slice off the top and bottom of the lemon. You want to have the interior flesh showing, not the pith (the white stuff is the pith.)\n          * Stand the lemon up on one cut end on your cutting board.\n          * CAREFULLY take all the pith off with your knife, by cutting downwards. Basically you want to try to follow the curvature between the white stuff and the actual flesh of the lemon. No need to be obsessive about it, though; you can trim it up as you go. Once you've got all the pith off, turn the lemon on its side and slice it up, as narrow as you can, but again, don't worry too much about it. I aim for about 1/8 inch, or 2-3 millimeters, but 4-5 mm isn't going to make or break this operation.\n          * You may run into annoying seeds as you go. Pick these out and discard them.\n\nCombine the sugar, flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Then add butter, eggs, water, lemon zest, and cayenne.\n\nLay down the bottom crust into your piepan. Lay the lemon slices onto the crust, spreading them out evenly as you can. Pour in any juices left over from the slicing, too. The lemons are going to look lonely and puny, but fear not.\n\nGently pour in your filling, then cover it all with the top crust. Try to tuck the edges of the top crust underneath the upward edges of the bottom edge to seal it all together, and crimp it. (I suck at this, but I haven't had a blow out yet. Just go for it!)\n\nRemember that beaten eggwhite in the ingredients list? Here's where it comes in. Brush it well over the top crust. It will enhance browning of the crust. If you don't have a pastry brush, a bit of folded paper towel or your fingers will do, just make sure to wash up well.\n\nLastly, sprinkle the pie lightly with more sugar. The eggwhite should catch it and hold it in place.\n\nBake 45 minutes -- and stave off the temptation at the end, because it will smell heavenly! Give it a few minutes to set, then snarf at will.",

Check your oil by dropping a chunk of battered flour into the pot. If there are no or few bubbles your oil is not hot enough. If it immediately blackens and smokes then it’s too hot. If you have a candy or deep fryer thermometer the temp you want is about 350°F.\n   8. Once your batter chunk bubbles and floats and slowly turns golden, your oil is ready.

Check cooked chicken with a meat thermometer, however don’t be surprised if it gives you a wacky number, my meat thermometer never says what its supposed to.

Also, use a smaller dash of cinnamon so as not to overpower the rosemary.\n\nPrebake your crust blind at 325°F for 18 minutes and set it aside to cool while you work on the rest of the tart.\n\nSome time during the down time involved with making the crust, you should get started on the creme anglaise. In a saucepan, add the milk, sugar, salt, and crushed cinnamon sticks (not ground cinnamon–you get a surprisingly different flavor this way. I just took the sticks, put them in a plastic bag, smashed them a few times with a hammer, and dumped them in). Scald (don’t boil) the milk, stir things up so the sugar doesn’t burn on the bottom, and then turn off the heat. Let this sit and infuse with cinnamonny goodness for an hour or so.\n\nOnce the milk has finished infusing, pour the mixture through a strainer into a bowl (to remove all of the cinnamon pieces) and then back into the saucepan. Take that bowl you just used and put it in an ice bath and set the strainer up on top. If this sounds like you’re making ice cream, well, yes, its pretty much the same process.\n\nWarm the milk back up on medium heat. While that warms, in the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the egg yolks until lightened in color. Then, temper the yolks with a good scoop of the hot milk, and then transfer the yolk mixture into the saucepan of hot milk. Keep cooking this on medium heat, stirring and scraping constantly for about 5 or so minutes until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, taking care not to scramble the eggs.\n\nOnce done, pour this through the strainer (to catch any scrambled bits) into the bowl in the ice bath. After a few minutes of letting your mixture cool down, cover it with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for a few hours so it can thoroughly chill.\n\nAnd now, yet another thing to do now so you can set it aside for later: make some whipped cream. This is pretty easy: in the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the heavy cream and confectioner’s sugar on high speed until firm peaks form. Transfer this to a bowl and set it aside in the fridge.\n\nNow, about 30-60 minutes before you intend to finally make the cream filling, set the cream cheese on your countertop so that it can come to room temperature. Then, in the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the cream cheese until nicely fluffed and creamy, at which point, you should beat in the sugar.\n\nThen, go get the cinnamon custard from the fridge. Slowly pour it into the cream cheese mix and beat this until well mixed. Take a taste. It shouldn’t be screamingly cinnamonny, but it still ought to have that distinct cinnamon taste, just a bit more seductive than the abrasive touch we’re all used to from ground cinnamon. If you’d prefer the cinnamon flavor to be more forward, sprinkle in a dash of ground cinnamon at this point.\n\nAt this point, things might be looking a little bit sloshy. To thicken it up, we’ll use the whipped cream you made earlier. Mix in about a quarter of the whipped cream to lighten things up a bit, and then, carefully and gently fold in the remaining whipped cream. Don’t overwork things or you’ll beat all the air and fluff out of the whipped cream.\n\nWith the filling ready, you can pour it into the pre-baked pie crust. Smooth it out to your liking and set this aside in the fridge for a few hours to firm up a bit more–it really needs to.\n\nThe end is near…kind of. Gather your apples, and working quickly, peel them, cut into quarters (not small wedges), and slice out the core.\n\nIn a pan, melt the butter on medium high heat. Once it stops foaming, mix in the sugar. Stir periodically, and soon enough, it should become caramel. Once it has, carefully place the apple quarters into the caramel (don’t get spattered and burned!), core side up. Continue to cook the apples on medium high heat for about 15 minutes, stirring periodically so things don’t stick and burn.\n\nOnce time is up, cover the pan, drop the heat to low, and let this sit for another 15 minutes, after which, you should remove this from the heat. Let the apple/caramel mixture return to room temperature before you arrange them on the tart. I simply arranged them in circles on top of the tart, core side down, and drizzled the extra caramel on top. Either set this back in the fridge or serve immediately. Either way, enjoy!",

      "title": "Fig, Fennel, and Prosciutto Pizza with Roasted Shallot Cream Sauce",
      "category": "Pizza",
      "directions": "First, you need to make your pizza dough, let it proof, and all of that good stuff.\n\nWhile you wait for the dough to be ready for action, you can prep all of the other pizza components. Dice up the fennel bulb (save the fronds for another day–they work as an herb), finely mince the pale part of a leek, stem and halve the figs, zest the lemon, grate/shred the gruyere, chop up thin slices of prosciutto, and finely dice the rosemary leaves. Whew, have a drink.\n\nNow the roasted shallot cream sauce requires a roasted shallot. The idea for the sauce is very much like a roasted garlic cream sauce I made a while back, so to start, lop off the top of a shallot, rub with a bit of olive oil, wrap tightly in tin foil, and roast it at 400°F in the oven for about 40 minutes.\n\nWhile the shallot is roasting, sauté the diced fennel for about 5 minutes in olive oil. Then, deglaze the pan with 3/4 cup of white wine. Braise this (simmer covered on low heat) until the shallot is done roasting, which for me, was somewhere around 30 minutes or so.\n\nWhen the shallot is done, remove the fennel from the pan (leave any liquid behind–top it off with more wine to bring it back up to about 3/4 cup) and set it aside. Heat up the white wine and add the cream, salt, and pepper. Warm this up over medium heat and squeeze the pulp out of the roasted shallot into the pan. Simmer this for about 15 minutes and puree it in the food processor. Simmer further until you’re happy with the texture (it should be somewhat thick) of the sauce and set this aside. Adjust seasoning to taste.\n\nAnd now, the rest of the toppings. Sauté the diced leek for about 5 minutes in olive oil to soften them up, add the figs for about 2 minutes and set this aside.\n\nAnd now, we can get moving on putting the pizza together. I cooked my pizza on a stone, and doing this requires about 45 minutes or so of preheating at the highest temperature you can get your oven (for me, 500°F) to warm the stone up.\n\nToss and shape your dough to be pizza sized. Work quickly–spread out the shallot sauce (leaving a border of unsauced dough for the crust) and sprinkle on the lemon zest and rosemary.\n\nAnd now pile on the rest. Spread the fennel, figs, leeks, prosciutto, and cheese. Get this in the oven for 10 minutes.\n\nOnce time is up, the crust should just be coloring, the cheese bubbly, and things should smell great. Let the pizza cool for a bit, cut yourself a slice, and dig in. Enjoy!",

Whisk oil into yeast, then beat in 4 eggs, one at a time, with remaining sugar and salt. Gradually add flour. When dough holds together, it is ready for kneading. (You can also use a mixer with a dough hook for both mixing and kneading, but be careful if using a standard size KitchenAid–it’s a bit much for it, though it can be done.)\n\n3. Turn dough onto a floured surface and knead until smooth. Clean out bowl and grease it, then return dough to bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, until almost doubled in size. Dough may also rise in an oven that has been warmed to 150 degrees then turned off. Punch down dough, cover and let rise again in a warm place for another half-hour.\n\n4. At this point, you can knead the raisins into the challah, if you’re using them, before forming the loaves. To make a 6-braid challah, either straight or circular, take half the dough and form it into 6 balls. With your hands, roll each ball into a strand about 12 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide. Place the 6 in a row, parallel to one another. Pinch the tops of the strands together. Move the outside right strand over 2 strands. Then take the second strand from the left and move it to the far right. Take the outside left strand and move it over 2. Move second strand from the right over to the far left. Start over with the outside right strand. Continue this until all strands are braided. For a straight loaf, tuck ends underneath. For a circular loaf, twist into a circle, pinching ends together. Make a second loaf the same way. Place braided loaves on a greased cookie sheet with at least 2 inches in between.\n\n5. Beat remaining egg and brush it on loaves. Either freeze breads or let rise another hour.\n\n6. If baking immediately, preheat oven to 375 degrees and brush loaves again. Sprinkle bread with seeds, if using. If freezing, remove from freezer 5 hours before baking.\n\n7. Bake in middle of oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden. (If you have an instant read thermometer, you can take it out when it hits an internal temperature of 190 degrees.) Cool loaves on a rack.\n\nNote: Any of the three risings can be done in the fridge for a few hours, for more deeply-developed flavor. When you’re ready to work with it again, bring it back to room temperature before moving onto the next step.\n\nRound or straight braid? Raisins or skip them?

Set aside near stovetop.\nIn a one-quart, heavy-bottomed, nonaluminum saucepan, heat milk over low heat, stirring often with small whisk, until it is steaming hot. Carefully add chopped chocolate mixture (don’t let the hot milk splash you as you do this!).\nContinue cooking mixture over low heat, stirring almost constantly with whisk and scraping bottom and sides of pot with rubber spatula frequently. Mixture will steam for several minutes before coming to a boil, and as temperature increases it will thicken slightly. When mixture achieves a boil, continue cooking and stirring for just 30 to 45 seconds.\nRemove from heat; whisk in vanilla and any optional ingredients. Divide among small mugs, top with light whipped cream, and serve immediately. Whipped cream isn’t mandatory as a garnish, but it actually cuts the richness and adds to the elegance. If you use a lightly sweetened whipped you will probably want to reduce the sugar or other sweetener in the drink.\nIf you have leftovers, cool briefly, then chill, covering tightly when cold. This will last for a day or three in the fridge. To reheat, make sure your mug is microwaveable. Heat in microwave at 50% (medium) power for short intervals, stirring well after each, just until mixture is very hot.\nTry to use top-quality chocolate. If you can only get grocery store cocoa powder, it won't be quite as yummy; get Schwarzenberger's, Hershey's or Droste and add the butter.\nNote: If using cocoa powder, muddle all ingredients together with a little milk, just enough to make a smooth paste, using the back of a spoon to rub the wet ingredients into the dry ones. Add a cup of milk very slowly to the paste, beating constantly to incorporate. Taste. You may want to add more milk, or any of the other ingredients to taste at this point. When you've got it right, put on the stove at low heat until it's as hot as you want it. Whisk briskly while heating and before pouring. Add a liberal dollop of whipped cream, if desired.\n\nComments about this recipe: Yes, you really do use up to 2 ounces of chocolate in a 7 ounce serving. The cornstarch is important. It does thicken the drink slightly, but there's more. Starch is an emulsifier which keeps the cocoa butter (which is a fat) from separating and rising, preventing that dark skin on top. With this small amount, most of the skin is prevented, but more makes the drink too thick. Also, don’t omit the salt here. You use a tiny quantity, but without it the drink will taste flat. ",

With your fingertips, mix in the liquid until large lumps form. Remove the large lumps and repeat with the remaining liquid and flour-butter mixture. Pat the lumps into a ball; do not overwork the dough. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. If preparing ahead of time, the dough can be stored at this point for up to one month in the freezer.\n\n2. Divide the refrigerated dough in half.

Repeat the rolling, cutting, and chilling process with the remaining half of dough.

Just because I saw it in the cupboard and decided to give it a shot. More on this below.\n\nWhile the chocolate melts, separate the eggs (see here for tips). If you're thinking ahead, you'll set aside the two extra yolks to make mayonnaise once you're done with this. \n\nStart mixing the chocolate and butter together as soon as you see the chips start to melt.\n\nIf you've never melted chocolate before, you might want to separate the eggs first so you aren't distracted. When the chocolate is completely melted, and the sugar and cocoa are incorporated, remove it from the heat and mix the yolks in one at a time.\n\nSet the chocolate mixture aside and let it cool to room temperature. While it's cooling, add the cream of tartar to the egg whites and beat until it forms stiff peaks.\n\nFor the first minute the egg whites will just foam up a little. Then all at once they'll turn pure white and look like a whole different food. Add about a third of the meringue to the chocolate and mix it in. Then add the rest and fold it in gently.\n\nTry not to deflate the eggs while folding.

If you're fussy about this stuff, make sure the top looks nice.\n\n    Remember when I mentioned the raw sugar? You can see a little bit of a speckled texture on the surface. Because raw sugar isn't ground as fine as refined white, it didn't completely dissolve in the melted chocolate. Once it's frozen, you'll barely notice the difference. As it thaws you'll notice a slight crispy granularity. Personally, I liked it, but if you're expecting silky-smoothness you'd be better off using powdered sugar.

      "directions": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.\n\nTo make the pastry, combine the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Cut in the chunks of cold butter with a pastry blender, a little at a time, until the dough resembles cornmeal. Add the 2 egg yolks and the ice water, and blend for a second just to pull the dough together and moisten. Be careful not to overwork the dough. Form the dough into a ball, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap, and let it rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour.\n\nWhile the dough is resting, prepare the filling.\n\nTo make the caramel sauce: place the sugar and water in a small pot and cook, stirring constantly, over medium-low heat until the sugar has melted and caramelized, about 10 minutes. Remove the pot from the burner and add the cream and wine slowly. It may bubble and spit, so be careful. When the sauce has calmed down, return it to the flame, add the vanilla bean and heat it slowly, until the wine and caramel are smooth and continue to slowly cook until reduced by half. Remove from the heat and cool until thickened.\n\nFill a large bowl with cold water and squeeze in the lemon juice. Peel the apples with a paring knife, cut them in half, and remove the core with a melon baller. Put the apple halves in the lemon-water (this will keep them from going brown). Toss the apples with the flour and cinnamon.\n\nTake the dough out of the refrigerator, unwrap the plastic, and cut the ball in half. Rewrap and return 1 of the balls to the refrigerator, until ready for the top crust. Let the dough rest on the counter for 15 minutes so it will be pliable enough to roll out. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch circle. Carefully roll the dough up onto the pin and lay it inside a 10-inch glass pie pan. Press the dough into the pan so it fits tightly.\n\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\n\nSlice a couple of the apples at a time using a mandolin or a very sharp knife. The apples need to be thinly sliced so that as the pie bakes, they collapse on top of each other with no air pockets. This makes a dense, meaty apple pie. Cover the bottom of the pastry with a layer of apples, shingling the slices so there are no gaps. Ladle about 2 ounces of the cooled red wine caramel sauce evenly over the apple slices. Repeat the layers, until the pie is slightly overfilled and domed on the top; the apples will shrink down as the pie cooks. Top the apples with pieces of the butter.\n\nNow, roll out the other ball of dough just as you did the first. Brush the bottom lip of the pie pastry with a little beaten egg white to form a seal. Place the pastry circle on top of the pie, and using some kitchen scissors, trim off the overhanging excess from around the pie. Crimp the edges of dough together with your fingers to make a tight seal. Cut slits in the top of the pie so steam can escape while baking. Place the pie on a sheet tray and tent it with a piece of aluminum foil, so the crust does not cook faster than the apples.\n\nBake the caramel apple pie for 25 minutes on the middle rack. In a small bowl, combine the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar with the freshly grated cinnamon. Remove the foil from the pie and brush the top with the remaining egg white. Sprinkle evenly with the cinnamon sugar and return to the oven. Continue to bake for another 25 minutes, until the pie is golden and bubbling. Let the apple pie rest at room temperature for at least 1 hour to allow the fruit pectin to gel and set; otherwise the pie will fall apart when you cut into it. ",

      "directions": "Set a large pot of salted water on to boil. While that's coming to a boil, cut the potatoes into bit-sized pieces. You can peel them first if you want. I don't mind having the skin there in the finished dish, but you should make sure you cut out any eyes that have started to sprout. \n\nRinse them well in a colander before putting them in the boiling water, then boil until they're fork tender. Mine took about 15 minutes. It will depend on how small you dice them and what kind of potatoes you got. Drain them in the colander. Be careful pouring them into the colander. Steam is hot. (This could be your face.)\n\nWhile the potatoes are cooking, you can get started on the bacon. When I started dicing the bacon, I realized I had grabbed the two-pound pack from the freezer instead of a one-pound pack. \"Oops, too much bacon,\" I thought to myself. Then I realized how silly that sounded, \"Too much bacon.\" Can you even use those words in that order?\n\nFor some tips on getting better bacon, and how to cook it, take a look at the post on macaroni dinner salad. Cook it and transfer the finished bacon to the same bowl you're going to put the finished salad in. Pour off most of the fat (filter it and keep it for later) but leave a little in the pan.\n\nDice the onion and add it to the pan you cooked the bacon in. Sauté until translucent and starting to turn brown.\n\nIf you checked out that macaroni salad link above, you noticed I was using a non-stick pan, and this time I'm using stainless steel. Here's why. When the onion is cooked, deglaze the pan with the cider vinegar. Add enough to coat the entire bottom of the pan, and scrape up all the brown bacony goodness. If you need measurements -- and this is definitely not an exact science -- it's a little less than a half cup.\n\nRemove the pan from heat and stir in two or three tablespoons of dark brown sugar.\n\nAdd the potatoes and half the bacon back to the pan and toss everything together. Be careful not to smash the potatoes too much.\n\nDon't worry about getting it perfectly mixed. It's better to toss it quickly, so all the vinegar doesn't get absorbed into just one layer of the potatoes.\n\nTransfer the bacon to a smaller serving bowl. As soon as most of the vinegar is absorbed, turn everything out into the bowl. Top with more of the bacon. Serve with the rest of the bacon on the side for people who want even more bacon. (And who doesn't like even more bacon?)\n",

The more flour, the harder and heavier they will be. In Napoli in the 18th century they made it with flour only - great if you need to choke a priest but not very light. Potato-based gnocchis are much superior and used everywhere in Italy nowadays.\n\nMy gnocchi dough is not very smooth and is quite chunky.

Hastily made gnocchi have no shape - they look like small barrels. By pressing each gnoccho gently on a fine grater or a bamboo mat, you will make it thinner, curved on one side and marked with little cavities on the other. This will result in a lighter gnoccho to which a much larger quantity of ragù will stick. They are also more appealing to the eye.\n\nThese are not the nicest gnocchis ever, but I made another batch the next day with much nicer results. Both tasted the same, so good luck!\n\nBring salted water to a high boil and don't add oil no matter what your daddy told you.

Remove from heat and set aside to cool.\n\n9. When the dough is doubled, punch it down and roll it out on a lightly floured surface into a 12-by-18-inch rectangle. Spread the apples and bacon bits evenly over the dough.\n\n10. Roll the dough lengthwise into a tube (like a cinnamon roll), making sure the seam is on the bottom of the roll. Make 15 slits over the length of the roll, a little over 1 inch apart and three-fourths of the way through. Carefully transfer the dough to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Form the dough into the shape of a wreath, with the cut sides on the outside of the wreath. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and set aside until almost doubled in volume, 45 minutes to an hour. Alternatively, loosely cover and refrigerate the dough overnight; remove from the refrigerator about 1 hour before baking for the dough to come to room temperature.\n\n11. Heat the oven to 375 degrees. In a small bowl, whisk together 1 tablespoon maple syrup with the remaining egg. Brush the egg wash over the outside of the wreath. Sprinkle the sliced almonds over the wreath and place the pan in the oven.\n\n12. Bake the coffee cake until golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Rotate the pan halfway through baking for even coloring.\n\n13. While the coffee cake is baking, make the glaze. In a medium bowl, whisk together the cream cheese, powdered sugar, 1 tablespoon bacon grease and maple syrup.\n\n14. Remove the cake and brush the top with the remaining tablespoon bacon grease. Allow the cake to cool slightly.\n\n15. Drizzle the glaze over the warm coffee cake. Slice and serve. The coffee cake will keep for up to two days, refrigerated. Cover and bring to room temperature before serving.\n",

Transfer to a clean bowl.\n   3. Add the onion, the eggs, flour, salt, and pepper. Thoroughly combine the mixture.\n   4. In a large, preferably straight-sided pan, add oil to a depth of ¼ to ⅓ inch. Heat oil until a shred of potato dropped in the oil sizzles immediately.\n   5. Form pancakes, using 2 tablespoons from a regular silverware set. Scoop up a generous spoonful of the potato mixture with one spoon, flatten the mixture with the other spoon. Slide the latke into the oil. Repeat until the pan is full, but not crowded. Cook the latkes until browned at the edges. Turn the latkes over and cook until fully browned. Transfer the finished latkes to the lined baking sheet to drain excess oil. Repeat with the remaining mixture.\n   6. If not serving the latkes immediately, transfer the sheet to the preheated oven to keep warm. If serving even later, set the latkes aside to cool to room temperature, then freeze until ready to serve. Reheat the latkes in a 350-degree oven, and drain again on paper towels because reheating will release more oil.\n      Serve with sour cream or applesauce. Add salt to taste.\n",

      "title": "Bacon Sausage Roll",
      "category": "Appetizers",
      "directions": "To kick off the construction of this pork medley you’ll need to create a 5×5 bacon weave.  If the strips you’re using aren’t as wide as the ones pictured, then you may need to use a few extra slices to fill out the pattern.  Just make sure your weave is tight and that you end up with a nice square shape to work with.\n\nThe next step is to add some barbeque seasoning on top of your bacon weave.  Being the barbeque addict that I am, I whipped up a batch of Burnt Finger BBQ’s competition pork rub for this special occasion.  Seeing as not everyone has the time, or the expertise, to create a tasty rub of their own, I would recommend trying Bad Byron’s Butt Rub, Rendezvous Famous Seasoning, or Steven Raichlen’s All-Purpose Rub.\n\nNow that you’re pork is well seasoned, it’s time to add more pork.  Take two pounds of Italian sausage and layer it directly on top of your bacon weave.  Be sure to press the sausage to the outer edges of the bacon creating a patty that is the same thickness all the way across.  Most grocery stores carry loose sausage, so just pick out one you like.  I chose to go with a mild sausage, but spicy would work just the same.  If you really want to get crazy, take a stab at making your own homemade sausage.\n\nNext up is bacon layer number two.  Take the remaining bacon slices and fry them up the same way you would for breakfast (or lunch, or dinner, or a midnight snack).  If you like soft bacon, make it soft.  If you like crunchy bacon, make it crunchy.  If you like your bacon burnt to hell so the smoke detectors go off, then burn it to hell so the smoke detectors go off.  These pieces are going to be a major part of the inner flavor of our sausage fatty, so cook them your favorite way.  Personally, I like my bacon right at the point when it starts to get crispy, but hasn’t quite lost all of the softness yet.  Regardless of how well done you like yours, you’ll need to crumble or chop the cooked strips into bite size pieces and place on top of the sausage layer.  (Note-It’s okay, and encouraged, to snack on these pieces while your chopping/crumbling.  But keep in mind that once those bacon morsels touch the raw sausage, you’ll need to resist all temptations to nibble.  This can and will be difficult, but hospital trips are no fun, so stay strong.)\n\nSince this is a barbeque recipe, we need to add another layer of barbeque flavor.  Take your favorite sauce and drizzle it all over the top of the bacon pieces.  Personally, I prefer to use Burnt Finger BBQ’s homemade competition sauce, but if you’re torn on what brand to use I recommend Cowtown, Blues Hog, and Fiorella’s Jack Stack.  Once you’ve sauced the bacon, sprinkle on some more of the barbeque seasoning you used on the bacon weave.\n\nNow comes the fun part.  Very carefully separate the front edge of the sausage layer from the bacon weave and begin rolling backwards.  You want to include all layers EXCEPT the bacon weave in your roll.  Try and keep the sausage as tight as possible and be sure to release any air pockets that may have formed.  Once the sausage is fully rolled up, pinch together the seams and ends to seal all of the bacon goodness inside.\n\nAt this point we can start to see the final shape of our Bacon Explosion, but we’re missing one key item.  To complte the constuction process, roll the sausage forward completely wrapping it in the bacon weave.  Make sure it sits with the seam facing downward to help keep it all sealed up.\n\nSprinkle some barbeque seasoning on the outside of the bacon weave, and now this bad boy is ready for the smoker.  Cook your Bacon Explosion at 225 degrees in a constant cloud of hickory smoke until your Thermapen gives an internal temperature reading of 165 degrees.  Normally this will take about 1 hour for each inch of thickness, but that could vary depending on how well you maintain your fire and also how many times you open the smoker to take a peek.  Mine took about 2.5 hours, which was right on target with its 2.5 inch diameter.\n\nNow that our Bacon Explosion is fully cooked, we need to add some finishing flavors.  Remember that barbecue sauce we used for inner flavor?  We’ll be using that same sauce to glaze the cooked bacon weave.  Using a basting brush, coat the entire surface with a thin layer of sauce.  Sweet sauces are loaded with sugars, so they’ll give your fatty a nice glossy finish.  Spicy and vinegar based sauces don’t contain as much, so they won’t set up as well.  If you’re dead set on using those sauces, just cut them with a bit of honey and you’ll get the same effect.\n\nSlice the Bacon Explosion into quarter to half inch rounds to serve.  If your roll was good and tight, you should now see a nice bacon pinwheel pattern throughout the sausage.  Obviously pork is best served by itself, but if you feel the need to make this meat monster into a sandwich, try placing a couple Bacon Explosion slices on a warm Pillsbury’s Grands Biscuit.  You’ll reach pork Nirvana is no time flat!",

Now, take all those quarters, and layer them in the bottom of your greased bundt pan. \n\nOnce the first layer are in the pan, it's safe to go ahead and cut the other 1 1/2 cans of biscuits into quarters and have them ready for your second layer.\n\nIn a small sauce pan, melt your butter. Remember, 1 1/2 sticks.\n\nMeasure out 1 1/2 cups of packed brown sugar.\n\nAdd the brown sugar to your melted butter. Then add 1 1/2 tablespoons of cinnamon. When you get a nice deep brown color, stir in 1 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans, your choice.\n\nWhen the mixture looks like the above (about 1-2 minutes), pour the mixture into a 2 cup measuring jug. You should have exactly 2 cups of this mixture now. 1 cup will go on the lower layer, and 1 cup will go on the top layer of biscuit quarters.\n\nPour the mixture around the bundt pan, over the biscuit quarters. Remember, use only half of your mixture, about 1 cup.\n\nOnce you've gone completely around the pan, and used 1 cup of your brown sugar mixture, start layering on the next set of biscuit quarters.\n\nWhen the pan looks like this, pour on your 2nd half of liquid.\n\nNow place your pan in your preheated oven, and bake for 45-55 minutes, or until golden brown. It is important not to overcook this cake. For all it's simplicity, it is a very easy cake to make tough by overcooking. So start conservatively at 45 minutes, and if it doesn't look like this picture at that mark, give it 5 more minutes, and keep checking back at 2-5 minute intervals.\n\nOnce out of the oven, give the cake 10 minutes to cool slightly, and then flip on to a plate or platter:\n\nNow you can really see why it's called 'Pluck It' cake. As soon as this is even remotely cooled off enough to touch, humans become like ravenous hyenas, ripping this sucker apart. It's incredibly addicting, and once you've had one little piece, you can't stop eating it.\n\nP.S. Feel free to microwave a piece the next morning for breakfast.

Roll out the dough into a 1/4-inch rectangle, then cut into 2-inch squares using a pizza wheel or a sharp knife.  Place a half-ounce of bittersweet chocolate into the center of each square.  Gather the edges of the dough around the filling, pinching at the center to form a seal; you may need to use a bit of water to help the edges stick together. \n\nAllow to rest for 15 to 20 minutes while the oil heats up to 360 to 370 degrees F. for deep frying– clip a candy thermometer to the pot to be sure, don’t try to estimate.  You need lots of oil, 3 or 4 inches so the beignets can sink, and then float to the top.  Watch the temperature– it’s too cool, they’ll absorb too much oil; too hot and they’ll burn on the outside and be gummy on the inside.  360 to 370 is just right. \n\nCarefully drop the beignets into the hot oil, giving them room to rise to the surface and get a nice rise; don’t crowd them.  Have your adorable spouse, friend, or other important person help you with this crucial job; ask them to adjust the temperature if it falls below 360 once the beignets are added to the pot.  Laura’s so good at this that she can read the paper while making perfect beignets/soufganiyot (it’s not hard)!\n\nAfter 2 minutes, gently flip them with a slotted spoon and fry for another minute, or until golden brown on both sides.  Use the slotted spoon to remove beignets from the oil and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with remaining dough until all the beignets are fried.

More sugar means a sweeter cider, and more alcohol, darker sugar means a darker cider with a stronger flavor. I like about 4.5 cups, half dark-brown and half white sugar.\n   3. Add enough apple juice to the saucepan to dissolve the sugar over low heat. You shouldn't need more than half of the remaining cider.\n   4. Once the sugar is dissolved, let the mixture cool slightly, and pour it back into the bottle (use a funnel if you need to). The bottle should now be full of warm extra-sweet juice.\n   5. Toss in about 1/2 tsp of yeast (a yeast packet usually holds a little over 2 tsp, so don't throw the whole thing in), and top off the bottle with the juice you set aside in step 1. Leave a few inches at the top of the bottle -- don't let it get too full.\n   6. Wash the powdered anti-stick stuff out of the balloon, and prick it with a pin. Then place the balloon on top of the bottle. The pinprick will be enough to let air escape from the bottle, but not big enough to let any nasty bacteria back in.\n   7. That's it! Let this sit for 2-3 weeks.\nAfter 2-3 weeks, you will need to \"rack\" the cider. Racking is the process of siphoning the cider off the top of the lees (dead yeast). You can use a siphon if you want, but if you're careful, the 1-gallon bottle is small enough that you can usually just pour the good stuff off the top. Don't worry if you get a little lees along with the cider, since you have to rack it again, anyway. Replace the balloon (using a new one if necessary) and let the cider continue to ferment.\n\nRack the cider again every 2-3 weeks until there is no more lees at the bottom of the bottle. The cider is drinkable at any stage, but it starts to get good at about 2-3 months, and excellent around 9 months (and so far, I've only seen it get better with age).\n\nImportant: Please make sure that you do not reseal the juice bottle with its original lid until you are completely sure that there is no live yeast left. This kind of bottle was not made to handle pressure, and if you have any live yeast left over, you risk building up more pressure than the bottle can handle. Since the cap screws on stronger than the glass can hold, if it blows, you'll end up with sticky broken glass all over your kitchen (or wherever you chose to set your brew). Trust me, you don't want that. \n",

Sprinkle in some crushed red pepper flakes or cayenne if you like things a little spicy. Whisk it together until smooth.\n\nNext, rinse the chicken breasts under cool water and pat them dry. We’re going to pound the chicken breasts so they have a more uniform thickness, which means they’ll cook more evenly and won’t be dry around the edges. Place one chicken breast between two sheets of waxed paper. Lightly pat the waxed paper so it adheres to the chicken. With a mallet or a rolling pin (you can also use a heavy can!) lightly pound the chicken breast so that the thickness is uniform. By the time it all evens up, it’s usually around 1/2 to 3/4″ thick. If the chicken breasts are overly huge, I often cut them in half just to create more manageable (and kid-friendly) pieces.\n\nNext, just add all the chicken to the bowl with the marinade. You’ll want to cover this with plastic wrap and let it marinate in the fridge for at least an hour-usually I let it go about 2 to 3 hours, but that’s only because I’m always running behind.\n\nWhile the chicken is marinating, go ahead and fry up some bacon. Keep in mind that the bacon will eventually go into the oven, so you don’t want to get it too crisp in the skillet.\n\nNext, and this is important, reserve 1/4 cup of the bacon grease, and go ahead and clean out the skillet. Otherwise, it’ll get too smoky.\n\nWhen you’re ready to prepare the chicken, preheat the oven to 400 degrees.\n\nRemove the chicken from the fridge and pour off excess marinade into the sink. Heat half of the reserved bacon grease with an equal quantity of Canola Oil in the clean skillet over medium-high to high heat. (We want to sear the chicken, not cook it completely.) When the grease is sufficiently heated, add a batch of chicken to the skillet. Don’t overcrowd the skillet-just 3 pieces is usually enough.\n\nWatch the chicken, and when it starts to get brown/black on one side. Flip it to the other side. Cook just until brown/blackish areas appear. Each side should cook for a maximum of 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Repeat with all the chicken breasts, then set them on a large baking sheet.

      "category": "Potatoes",
      "directions": "Get the garlic ready for roasting\n\nIdeally, you’re already using your oven for something else seeing how this is a side dish and all. I say that because it would seem wasteful to get your oven going just to roast a head of garlic, which is the first step. Doing this is simple: preheat the oven to 400?F and lop off the top of the head of garlic so as to expose a little bit of all of the cloves. Then, wrap the garlic in tin foil (with the opening on top) and drizzle in some olive oil, doing your best to coat all of the cloves. Then tightly, wrap your tin foil shut and put this in the oven. You might consider putting a pan underneath the garlic in case your tin foil efforts aren’t perfect (hey, it happens). Roasting the garlic takes about 45 minutes, so leave that going.\n\nBoil the potatoes\n\nWhile that’s taking place, get a big pot of water boiling. Once boiling, place your potatoes in the water (don’t bother peeling them!), doing your best to ensure that they are all submerged in the water. Depending on how crowded your pot is, boiling these guys will cost you somewhere upwards of 20 minutes–just move them around periodically (so they all cook evenly) and give a poke now and then to see when they’re tender. When you think you’re done, be sure you check that all of your potatoes are tender–they come in different shapes and sizes so they will cook differently and one undercooked potato will throw things off.\n\nWhile you wait for the potatoes to tender up, get all of your other ingredients ready. In a small bowl, mix all but the chives and heat briefly in the microwave to get the butter softened and the buttermilk down to something warmer than room temperature. Dice up the chives (or scallions–whatever you have handy) and toss these in the bowl as well.\n\nStart mashing the wet into the potatoes\n\nOnce finally sufficiently fork tender, pour out the water. Some like to reserve some of the water to mash into the potatoes to keep things moist. I prefer to instead achieve moisture through buttermilk as you get added richness, but if you’re counting calories, water might be more diet friendly. While the potatoes are still warm, you want to take this time to beat them down. I have a potato masher and like to have somewhat rustic-styled, coarsely mashed potatoes where there’s still some small chunks and strips of skin in there. If you’re more in the pureed baby-food crowd (I kid I kid!), feel free to use a ricer instead. Whatever you do, just don’t overdo it–overworking the potatoes (e.g. in a food processor) will make them gluey.\n\nAs you mash the potatoes up, pour in the bowl of wet ingredients and incorporate this into the potatoes. Ideally, your roasted garlic should be done about now, so once cool enough to handle, open the tin foil, squeeze the base of the garlic to pop all of the cloves out of the garlic paper and into your potatoes they go. Mash everything together until well mixed. If the potatoes don’t quite seem moist/rich enough for your tastes, add a dab more buttermilk and/or butter, mashing, retasting, and adding more as necessary. Feel free to season with a pinch of salt and pepper to taste.",

      "directions": "   1. Heat a large nonstick saucepan over medium heat and cook the bacon, stirring often, until almost crisp. Add the onions, sugar, and salt, and cook, stirring often until they cook down by two-thirds, about 10 minutes. Add 2 teaspoons vinegar, reduce the heat to medium-low, and continue to cook until the onions are an even golden brown and softened to a marmalade consistency, 30-45minutes, depending on the onions. Stir often and scrape up any brown bits clinging to the bottom of the pan. The onions need almost constant stirring near the end to prevent them from sticking and burning. They’ll let you know they need attention by giving off a sizzling sound. Stir in the sage, allow them to cool slightly, then taste and season with black pepper and additional salt if needed. If the onions seem overly sweet, stir in another teaspoon of vinegar.\n   2. Blend cream cheese and butter. Stir in flour and salt just until blended. Roll into little balls and place in greased mini muffin tins; you should get 36. Using a tart shaper, press dough into muffin tins to form little shells, flouring the tart shaper when necessary. Chill for about 1 hour.\n   3. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Stir cream or half and half into onion mixture. Place a piece of brie in the bottom of each tartlett.Divide filling evenly among chilled tart shells, and bake until filling is set and dough is lightly browned; about 20 minutes.\n   4. Cool and remove from pans. Serve warm or at room temperature.\n   5. Notes from Cara: These can be frozen in a single layer and then transferred to a plastic freezer bag. To reheat these kind of appetizers at my parties, I usually keep the oven on at about 400F with cookie sheets inside, so they are constantly kept warm. I warm up frozen appetizers as necessary by just placing them on the hot cookie sheets for about 10-12 minutes. This works for any kinds of little tarts, mini quiches, potato pancakes, mini turkey burgers, or fried wontons, etc, that have been cooked and frozen.\n\n",

      "directions": "Getting ready:  Have an instant-read thermometer, a strainer and a blender (first choice) or food processor at hand.  Bring a few inches of water to a simmer in a saucepan.\n\nPut the sugar and zest in a large heatproof bowl that can be set over the pan of simmering water.  Off heat, rub the sugar and zest together between your fingers until the sugar is moist, grainy and very aromatic.  Whisk in the eggs, followed by the lemon juice.\n\nSet the bowl over the pan, and start stirring with the whisk as soon as the mixture feels tepid to the touch.  You want to cook the cream until it reaches 180 degrees F.  As you whisk -- and you must whisk constantly to keep the eggs from scrambling -- you’ll see that the cream will start out light and foamy, then the bubbles will get bigger, and then, as the cream is getting closer to 180 degrees F, it will start to thicken and the whisk will leave tracks.  (See my blog post about getting the cream up to temperature.)  Heads up at this point -- the tracks mean the cream is almost ready.  Don’t stop whisking and don’t stop checking the temperature.  And have patience -- depending on how much water you’ve got under the cream and how much heat you’re giving the cream, getting to temp can take as long as 10 minutes. \n\nAs soon as it reaches 180 degrees F, remove the cream from the heat and strain it into the container of a blender (or food processor); discard the zest.  Let the cream rest at room temperature, stirring occasionally, until it cools to 140 degrees F, about 10 minutes.\n\nTurn the blender to high (or turn on the food processor) and, with the machine going, add about 5 pieces of butter at a time.  Scrape down the sides of the container as needed while you’re incorporating the butter.  Once the butter is in, keep the machine going -- to get the perfect light, airy texture of lemon-cream dreams, you must continue to beat the cream for another 3 minutes.  If your machine protests and gets a bit too hot, work in 1-minute intervals, giving the machine a little rest between beats.\n\nPour the cream into a container, press a piece of plastic wrap against the surface to create an airtight seal and chill the cream for at least 4 hours or overnight.  When you are ready to construct the tart, just whisk the cream to loosen it and spoon it into the tart shell.\n\nServing:  The tart should be served cold, because it is a particular pleasure to have the cold cream melt in your mouth.  Fruit coulis is nice with the tart, but not necessary, ditto a little crème fraiche.  I know it sounds odd to offer something as rich as crème fraiche with something as rich as this tart, but it works -- because the lemon cream is so light and so intensely citric, it doesn’t taste or feel rich, a situation that is potentially dangerous and positively delightful.\n\nStoring:  While you can make the lemon cream ahead (it will keep in the frige for 4 days and in the freezer for up to 2 months), once the tart is constructed, it’s best to eat it the day it is made.",

Pour all of this into the bowl of your stand mixer that is fitted with the paddle attachment. Add 1 tablespoon yeast and one cup whole wheat white flour or just plain old white flour. Turn the mixer on to a medium speed and let it mix for 3 minutes. After the three minutes scrap the mixer bowl down and turn it on to a low speed. Begin gradually adding white flour by the cup, pausing between cups to allow the mixer to incorporate the flour into the dough. You should be adding 3 to 4 cups depending upon the weather.\n\nOnce the dough clears the bowl and spins freely in the bowl you will want to stop the mixer and feel the dough. If it still sticks to your hands you can knock it off the paddle and add more flour…but go easy because you don’t want the dough to be too dry…it should just barely cling to your hand. Once it’s at the right consistency you should switch from the paddle to the bread hook. let the bread hook work the dough for at least 7 minutes. Once the time is up, stop the mixer, move the dough to a oiled work bowl, flip the dough about a bit in the bowl to get the top side oiled and then cover it with saran and put it in the refrigerator.\n\nFor most of the day you should feel free to absolutely ignore it. If you feel so inclined you can poke at it, or if it’ll make you feel better you can actually take it out of the refrigerator, punch it down and then put it back in…but you don’t have to.\n\nStep Two (1.5 hours before you wish to eat dinner)\n\nRemove the dough from the refrigerator and toss it out onto a counter lightly dusted with flour. Give it a few punches and roll it about a bit to deflate it. Walk away from it for ten minutes.\n\nWhen you return divide the dough into two equal pieces and begin to roll it and shape it with your hands into a long cylinder of dough. Once you complete one move on to the other, letting the first one rest. Don’t fret about the actual shape or anything other than just trying to create a log of dough that is about 15 inches long. The cut the logs into piece about 1.5 to 2 inches wide. Arrange these pieces on parchment covered cookie sheets. Place a clean dish towel on top of each sheet and walk away for another 20 to 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425F.\n\nStep Three (you’re only a few minutes from eating these tasty morsels, can you believe it?)\n\nWith a sharp paring knife you will slit each roll with a shallow gash. Then slide one sheet of rolls in the oven. I have a convection oven and it takes about 12 minutes so I think 15 would suffice for other ovens. However, you actually set the timer for 8 minutes and then you keep a close eye on them thereafter. When they’re golden brown they’re done.

This will soften the honey and allow for an easier time when pouring it into the spring water. Fill the container up with the remaining spring water, leaving a couple of inches from the top. Put the cap back on the mixture and shake the container vigorously for a few minutes.\n\nWhen the mixture is evenly mixed, you take the cap off and place the balloon over the mouth of the container. Poke a small hole in the balloon. This will allow for the gases to slowly escape, while preventing foreign contaminants from entering your mixture. If the balloon does not feel tight enough, you may need to use rubber bands around the mouth of the container to keep it on tight.\n\nThis is the finished batch. I will let it sit 3-6 months depending on when Peace Corps comes a calling. Over the next twenty-four hours, your balloon will start to inflate. Watch carefully to make sure the balloon does not inflate so large that it pops off. If you feel there is too much stress on your balloon, you can poke another hole to allow more gases to escape. When you are comfortable that your balloon will hold, place your mixture in a cool, dry place like a closet or a kitchen cabinet. The fermentation process will last two to three weeks. At the end of this period, the balloon will go limp.\n\nPatience is the name of the game at this point. For your batch of mead to get really tasty, you will need to let it sit for at least two and a half more months.

Set eggs aside.\n\n- Fry bacon in 10-inch nonstick oven safe skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towel-lined plate; pour off all but 1 tablespoon of bacon fat. Add potatoes to skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir mozzarella and bacon into eggs; add egg mixture to skillet and cook, using spatula to stir and scrape bottom of skillet, until large curds form and spatula begins to leave wake but eggs are still very wet, about 1 minute. Shake skillet to distribute eggs evenly; cook without stirring for 30 seconds to let bottom set.\n\n- Slide skillet under broiler and broil until frittata has risen and surface is puffed and spotty brown, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes; when cut into with paring knife, eggs should be slightly wet and runny. Remove skillet from oven and let stand 5 minutes to finish cooking; using spatula, loosen frittata from skillet and slide onto platter or cutting board. Cut into wedges and serve.\n\n\n",
